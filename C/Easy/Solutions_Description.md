# Absolute Difference Pointers (Easy)
- **Objective**: Understand pointer operations and memory modification.
- **Task**: Implement `void update(int *a, int *b)` that modifies `a` to their sum and `b` to their absolute difference.
- **Concepts**: Pointer usage (`*`, `&`), modifying values via pointers.


# Bitwise Operators (Easy)
- **Objective**: Work with bitwise operations (`AND`, `OR`, `XOR`).
- **Task**: Given an integer `n` and a threshold `k`, find the maximum values of:
  - `AND` operation (`&`) below `k`
  - `OR` operation (`|`) below `k`
  - `XOR` operation (`^`) below `k`
- **Concepts**: Bitwise operators, comparisons, optimization.


# Conditional Statement (Easy)
- **Objective**: Learn and implement `if-else` conditions.
- **Task**: Print the English word for a number (1-9), or `"Greater than 9"` otherwise.
- **Concepts**: Conditional statements, integer-to-string mapping.


# Conditionals and Loops (Easy)
- **Objective**: Work with `for` loops for iteration.
- **Task**: Iterate over a given range and print the English word for numbers (1-9), `"even"` for even numbers, and `"odd"` for odd numbers beyond 9.
- **Concepts**: `for` loops, conditional checks (`if-else`), string output formatting.


# Hello World (Easy)
- **Objective**: Introduces basic C syntax for input and output operations.
- **Task**: Print `"Hello, World!"` followed by an input string using `printf()`.
- **Concepts**: Standard input (`stdin`) and output (`stdout`), `printf()` function.


# Max Number Function (Easy)
- **Objective**: Learn function creation and usage in C.
- **Task**: Implement `int max_of_four(int a, int b, int c, int d)` that returns the maximum of four integers.
- **Concepts**: Function declaration, return values, logic for finding the maximum.


# Playing with Characters (Easy)
- **Objective**: Learn to read and print a character, a string, and a sentence.
- **Task**: Accept and print a single character, a word, and a full sentence.
- **Concepts**: `scanf()` for single characters and words, `scanf("%[^\n]%*c", s)` for full sentences.


# Playing with Characters 2 (Easy)
This is the same problem as the one above^, optimized code


# Recursive Calculat Nth Term (Easy)
- **Objective**: Introduce recursion in C programming.
- **Task**: Given the first three terms (`a`, `b`, `c`) of a sequence, compute the `nth` term where:
  - `S(n) = S(n-1) + S(n-2) + S(n-3)`
- **Concepts**: Recursion, base cases, function calls.


# Student Marks Sum (Easy)
- **Objective**: Work with arrays and memory addresses.
- **Task**: Given an array `marks[]` storing students' scores:
  - If `gender = 'b'`, return the sum of marks at even indices (boys).
  - If `gender = 'g'`, return the sum of marks at odd indices (girls).
- **Concepts**: Array indexing, memory representation, pointers.


# Sum Difference (Easy)
- **Objective**: Work with `int` and `float` data types and arithmetic operations.
- **Task**: Read two integers and two floating-point numbers, then compute and print their sum and difference.
- **Concepts**: `scanf()` for multiple values, `printf()` formatting (`%d`, `%f`).


# Sum of Digits of Five Digit Number (Easy)
- **Objective**: Learn to use the modulo `%` and division `/` operators to extract digits.
- **Task**: Given a five-digit integer, compute and print the sum of its digits.
- **Concepts**: Modulo (`%`) for extracting digits, integer division (`/`).
